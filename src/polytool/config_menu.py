"""Interactive config menu: pure renderer + pure state machine + thin shell.

Canonical here (rendering half): :func:`render`, turning menu state (a schema-driven
field list, current values, cursor position, and optional edit/error state)
into a bordered ``list[str]`` of display lines. **Pure** — no ``print``, no
``sys.stdout``, no ``isatty`` checks, no cursor-movement escapes. That purity
is the entire point: every behavior here is a plain ``render(...) -> list``
call a test can assert on directly, with zero mocking of a terminal.

Schema-driven, not key-driven: :func:`render` iterates whatever ``Field``
tuple it is given (normally :data:`polytool.config_schema.FIELDS`) — there is
no per-key ``if``/``elif`` chain and no hardcoded list of the six known keys.
Masking is entirely delegated to :mod:`polytool.config_schema`
(``format_value``/``mask_secret``); this module never re-implements or
second-guesses a mask decision, and never prints a masked field's raw value.

Column alignment uses :func:`polytool._present.visible_len` (ANSI-stripped,
East-Asian-width aware), not ``len()`` — a CJK label or a colored value would
otherwise shift the box. The bordered look mirrors
:func:`polytool._present.panel`, but ``panel()`` prints and cannot express a
highlighted cursor row or an edit-buffer/error variant, so this module builds
its own border logic alongside it rather than forcing those needs through a
print-only helper.

**Deliberate decision — edit-buffer echo on a masked field:** while a value
is being typed (``editing=True``), the in-progress buffer is shown in
cleartext, even for ``telegram_bot_token``. This is the user's own terminal,
and the buffer holds a *new*, not-yet-saved value, never the previously
saved secret (which stays masked everywhere else, including mid-edit on
other rows). Recorded here so it reads as a choice, not an oversight.

**Data-loss rule — a masked row never round-trips its own value.** Opening a
masked field seeds the edit buffer EMPTY, never ``field.format(current)``:
``format`` returns the *mask* for a secret, so a prefilled buffer plus a
"looks fine, Enter" would commit ``********WXYZ`` as the new token and
silently destroy it. The empty buffer therefore means "type a new value",
and the two ways out both preserve what is stored:

* **Enter on an empty buffer CANCELS** (leaves the saved secret untouched)
  rather than writing ``""`` — blanking a token by pressing Enter twice is
  the same silent destruction in a different costume. There is deliberately
  NO bare-Enter path to clear a secret; ``config set telegram_bot_token ""``
  is the explicit, typed-out way to do that.
* **Escape cancels** as it does everywhere else.

**Data-loss rule — a save writes only the keys the user touched.** ``values``
is a snapshot taken when the menu opened, so posting all of it to
``save_config`` (whose merge is ``{**on_disk, **updates}``) would make that
stale snapshot beat every concurrent write — another terminal's freshly-set
``telegram_bot_token`` would silently revert to the one the session started
with. :class:`MenuState` therefore carries ``touched``, updated only where a
value actually changes, and :func:`_save` passes that subset. Side benefit: an
untouched key is never written, so the six defaults stop being materialised
into the file on every save. :func:`fallback_menu` already saved a single key
and needs nothing.

The same rule applies in :func:`fallback_menu` (a blank answer for a masked
field keeps the current value, and its prompt says so) — one root cause, both
call sites. Non-masked fields still prefill from ``field.format``, which is
lossless for bools/ints/plain strings and so cannot corrupt anything.

Canonical here (behavioural half): :class:`MenuState` + :func:`step`, the
**pure** ``(state, KeyEvent) -> state`` transition every behaviour test drives
from a fake key iterator; :func:`run_menu`, the thin terminal shell around it
(raw mode, in-place redraw, ``Spinner`` while saving); the non-TTY numbered
fallback; and :func:`cmd_config`, the ONE entry point all six CLIs delegate
to for both the menu and the scriptable ``config get`` / ``config set`` forms.

Delegated elsewhere: key decoding, raw mode and the "is a menu even possible"
check (:mod:`polytool._keyreader`); reading/writing the config file
(:mod:`polytool.autoswitch` — ``load_config``/``save_config``/``masked_config``,
never a direct write from here); per-key types, parsing, ranges and masking
(:mod:`polytool.config_schema`); colors, ``log_*`` and ``Spinner``
(:mod:`polytool._utils`).

Schema-driven, no per-key branching anywhere: whether a row is *typed* or
*cycled* comes from the descriptor (``choices``, or ``type is bool``), and
validation is ``Field.parse``. Appending a 7th field to
``config_schema.FIELDS`` needs no change here — see
``tests/test_config_menu.py::SeventhFieldTest``.

**Deliberate decisions, recorded so they read as choices:**

* *Quit with unsaved changes discards them* (with a yellow warning naming the
  ``s`` key) rather than prompting. A save-on-quit prompt on an escape-hatch
  keystroke is how a half-typed threshold gets persisted; ``s`` is one key.
* *``config set`` echoes a masked value for a masked key* — the only byte
  divergence from the legacy ``ai_accounts`` block, which echoed the raw
  token back. Every other key, including the ``True``/``False`` Python repr
  of booleans, is echoed byte-identically.
* *The non-TTY fallback exits 0 on immediate EOF* (piped/empty stdin): it has
  already printed the full config listing, which is the whole answer for a
  non-interactive caller — nothing failed, so nothing should look like it did.
  An invalid *choice* still exits 1, matching ``_present.choose_profile``.
* *``_present.choose_profile`` is not reused* for that fallback: its header and
  prompt are account-flavored and hardcoded ("Choose a … profile:", "Select
  account number:"), which would read as a bug on a settings list. The shared
  part — numbered rows, ``input()`` wrapped against ``EOFError``/
  ``KeyboardInterrupt``, invalid input to exit 1 — is followed exactly.
