"""ai-accounts — drive every AI account tool at once.

Fans a subcommand out to all three per-provider tools (codex-accounts,
claude-accounts, agy-accounts) so one command covers every provider. ``list``
runs the providers in parallel and captures their tables (its output embeds
ANSI unconditionally, so color survives the pipe); every other command runs
the providers one at a time with live stdio, so interactive flows (switch
pickers, login-switch) and TTY-gated color keep working.

USAGE
  ai-accounts                        Show this help (the available commands)
  ai-accounts list                   List all provider profiles (providers run in parallel)
  ai-accounts who | current          Show the active account for every provider
  ai-accounts refresh [<name>|--all] Refresh tokens across every provider
  ai-accounts sync                   Sync active auth back to its profile, every provider
  ai-accounts save <name>            Save the current login as <name> in every provider
  ai-accounts switch [<name>]        Switch profile in every provider (interactive, one at a time)
  ai-accounts remove <name>          Remove profile <name> from every provider
  ai-accounts login-switch <name>    Fresh login + save as <name>, every provider (interactive)
  ai-accounts -h | --help            Show this help

Each command is forwarded to codex-accounts, claude-accounts, and agy-accounts.
`list` runs them concurrently and prints each table in a fixed order; every
other command runs them one provider at a time with live output, so interactive
pickers and login flows work and color is preserved. Any argument after the
command (e.g. a profile name or `--all`) is passed through to each provider.
