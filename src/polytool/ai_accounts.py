"""ai-accounts — drive every AI account tool at once.

Fans a subcommand out to all five per-provider tools (codex-accounts,
claude-accounts, agy-accounts, grok-accounts, vibe-accounts) so one command covers every provider. ``list``
runs the providers in parallel and prints each provider's table as soon as
it finishes fetching (its output embeds ANSI unconditionally, so color
survives the pipe); every other command runs the providers one at a time
with live stdio, so interactive flows (switch pickers, login-switch) and
TTY-gated color keep working.

USAGE
  ai-accounts                        Show this help (the available commands)
  ai-accounts list                   List all provider profiles (providers run in parallel)
  ai-accounts who | current          Show the active account for every provider
  ai-accounts usage                  Show only the active account's usage row per provider
  ai-accounts refresh [<name>|--all] Refresh tokens across every provider
  ai-accounts sync                   Sync active auth back to its profile, every provider
  ai-accounts save [<name>]          Save the current login in every provider;
                                      no name = each provider derives its own name from
                                      its own active account's email (may differ per
                                      provider if they're logged into different accounts —
                                      intentional forwarding behavior, not a bug)
  ai-accounts switch [<name>]        Switch profile in every provider (interactive, one at a time)
  ai-accounts remove [<name>]        Remove profile in every provider; no name = interactive
                                      picker for each provider in turn
  ai-accounts login-switch <name>    Fresh login + save as <name>, every provider (interactive)
  ai-accounts autoswitch             Run the low-quota auto-switch check for every provider now
  ai-accounts autoswitch setup       One-time install of event hooks and timer fallback
  ai-accounts config                 Interactive config menu (arrow keys; numbered
                                      fallback when stdin isn't a TTY)
  ai-accounts config get [key]       Print the auto-switch config (or just one key); the
                                      telegram bot token is always masked
  ai-accounts config set <key> <val> Set one auto-switch config key (rejects unknown keys)
  ai-accounts install-timer [--interval N]
                                      Schedule the auto-switch check with the OS (default:
                                      every 1800s / 30 minutes)
  ai-accounts uninstall-timer       Remove the scheduled auto-switch check
  ai-accounts timer-status          Report whether the auto-switch check is scheduled
  ai-accounts -h | --help | help     Show this help

Each command is forwarded to codex-accounts, claude-accounts, agy-accounts, grok-accounts, and vibe-accounts.
`list` runs them concurrently and prints each table as soon as it finishes
(fastest provider first), with a spinner tracking how many are still
fetching in between; every other command runs them one provider at a time
with live output, so interactive pickers and login flows work and color is
preserved. Any argument after the command (e.g. a profile name or `--all`) is
passed through to each provider — except after `autoswitch`, which accepts
only the local `setup` action and otherwise rejects extra arguments.
