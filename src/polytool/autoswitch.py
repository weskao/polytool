"""Shared foundation for auto-switch-on-low-quota.

Holds the on-disk configuration (``~/.polytool/config.json``) and the
notification funnel used when a switch happens — or can't. Selection and
trigger logic lives elsewhere; this module only stores settings and speaks to
the user.

The key list itself is declared once, in :mod:`polytool.config_schema` (type,
default, allowed values, masked-ness, label); ``DEFAULTS`` and
``NOTIFY_CHANNELS`` below are derived from it, so a new setting is added there
and nothing here changes. Import direction is one-way: ``config_schema`` is a
leaf and must never import this module.

``switch_when_used_pct`` is a **USED** percentage, matching
``usage_format.UsageWindow.percentage`` (0-100 used), and the trigger fires
when ``used_pct >= switch_when_used_pct``:

switch_when_used_pct = 90 means: switch once 90% of the quota is USED, i.e. when 10% remains.
